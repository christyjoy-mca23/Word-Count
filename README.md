# Word-Count
### Description:
This HTML file is a simple web page that displays the first three most frequently occurring words in a given paragraph. The JavaScript code processes the paragraph, counts word occurrences, and then displays the top three words and their counts in the provided `div` element with the id "app".

### How to Run the Code:
1. Save the provided HTML code in a file with a ".html" extension, for example, "assignment.html".
2. Open the saved HTML file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

The webpage will display the first three most frequently occurring words and their counts from the given paragraph.

### Future Enhancements:
Here are some potential enhancements for the code and the webpage:

1. **User Interaction**: Allow users to input their own paragraphs and dynamically display the most frequent words.

2. **Interactive UI**: Add input fields and a button to allow users to input their own paragraphs, triggering the word frequency calculation when the button is clicked.

3. **Improved Styling**: Enhance the visual design of the webpage using CSS to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to handle cases where there is no text or invalid input.
